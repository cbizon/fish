  "TRANSCRIPTION NOTES": "The handwriting was a bit challenging to decipher in places, particularly with certain abbreviations and the location details. The word 'med.' for 'medium' and the abbreviation 'bp. Seine' for the method of capture, as well as 'Form. + eth.' as shorthand for preservatives, were interpreted from context. The note about Frost Ford being a local name, not found on most maps, was also included as additional information rather than part of the data fields."
