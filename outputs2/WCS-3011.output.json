  "TRANSCRIPTION NOTES": "The numbers '6-13' and '22 & 23' were written next to 'photos' and 'waypoint', which seem like metadata regarding photographs taken and coordinates but do not directly correspond to any particular form element. The 'MAP SHEET' entry may not be complete, as there is an 'or' that suggests the name could continue. There might be an issue with the latitude and longitude coordinates as they are slightly unclear. The numbers following 'See' in the 'COLLECTORS' entry might correspond to a reference number or a specific page as it is followed by '360'."
