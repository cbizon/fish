  "TRANSCRIPTION NOTES": "Some text was difficult to decipher; 'Slgt' abbreviation for CURRENT assumed to mean 'Slight'. The LOCALITY value 'Mine Runatte Racoon Ford' was interpreted as 'Mine Run at Racoon Ford' based on context. LAT and LONG values are duplicated, suggesting they may indicate a single point rather than a range. ELEV. and STREAM WIDTH were interpreted from context, as handwriting was challenging to read. GENERAL HABITAT value 'Large upl piedmont creek' assumed from context and handwriting. ADD. NOTES/SPECIES LISTS ETC. field is indicated to continue on back, detail not provided in transcription."
