  "TRANSCRIPTION NOTES": "The handwriting was challenging to decipher at times, particularly with the abbreviations used and some unclear lettering. 'Qty' in the 'GENERAL HABITAT' could be an abbreviation for 'quality,' 'quantity,' or another similar term. The map sheet has a number with uncertain characters '5G-601' (the middle character is ambiguous). The abbreviation 'sl' for stream current could stand for 'slight' or 'slow' and was determined based on the context. The entry 'see 3059' in the 'COLLECTORS' section appears to reference another data sheet or entry number."
